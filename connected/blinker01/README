See top level README for more information about schematics and the
datasheet for this microcontroller.

This connected launchpad board has two leds.  From the schematics
you can see that one is on PN0 and the other connected to PN1.

The GPIO section of the datasheet clearly lays out the procedure for
initializing a GPIO port, enabling clocks to the port so that the logic
is running, then configuring the individual port pins, input or output
pull up or down or neither, alternate functions, etc.

There is an interesting feature with this design that allows you to
write to the GPIODATA register in a masked fasion so that the write
only targets certain bits (pins) and leaves the others unchanged.  I
have used that feature in this example.

By changing the hardcoded value in the dowait() function you can
change the frequency of the blinking.
