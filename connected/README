Tiva C Launchpad Bare Metal Examples

This directory tree is for the "connected" launchpad.  The fancier one
with the ethernet connector on it.  currently called the EK-TM4C1294XL

As of this writing you start at

http://ti.com/launcpad

then click on the Tiva C series launchpads picture.  then click on the
EK-TM4C1294XL a.k.a Tiva C Series Connected LaunchPad picture

Under specs you will want to go to both links the TK-TM4C1294XL link
under Part Number.  And on the right column under Featured
Microcontroller the TM4C1294NCPDT link.

For the board (TK-TM4C1294XL) link under User Guides there is one
document spmu365 (not called that on the page).

For the microcontroller link (TM4C1294NCPDT) you will want the data
sheet, the first link not necessarily the errata but you may want
to get those as well.

The board documentation ends with a schematic from which we can for
example see that there are two leds D1 and D2 on port pins PN0 and PN1.

Start with blinker01 to blink the leds.

See the top level README for information on downloading programs to
the microcontroller using lm4flash.
