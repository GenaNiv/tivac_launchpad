Tiva C Launchpad Bare Metal Examples

ti bought this product line from luminary micro a while back.  The
luminary micro product name was stellaris and after they became ti it
was the stellaris but not long ago was renamed Tiva C.  And I see
that they now have renamed the parts from lm... to tm...

They had just one launchpad (under the stellaris name) now they have
more.  so I will leave my stellaris_launchpad repo there as was, but
it is moving here.  Not sure how to name them though will start with
a launchpad dir for the original and connected for the new connected
one.
