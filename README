Tiva C Launchpad Bare Metal Examples

ti bought this product line from luminary micro a while back.  The
luminary micro product name was stellaris and after they became ti it
was the stellaris but not long ago was renamed Tiva C.  And I see
that they now have renamed the parts from lm... to tm...

They had just one launchpad (under the stellaris name) now they have
more.  so I will leave my stellaris_launchpad repo there as was, but
it is moving here.  Not sure how to name them though will start with
a launchpad dir for the original and connected for the new connected
one.


For both boards as of this writing I use the lm4flash utility (Linux)
to program the boards.

apt-get install libusb-1.0.0-dev build-essential
git clone http://github.com/utzig/lm4tools.git
cd lm4tools/lm4flash
make

Then use the lmflash tool by adding it to your path, making a symlink
to it from somewhere in the path (/usr/local/bin) etc.

/path/lm4flash myprogram.bin

I have a build_gcc repository from which you can use build_gcc to
build a gnu toolchain which will build all of these examples.  or you
can go to codesourcery.com which is now mentor graphics, and find
the lite version of their tools (no time limit, look around you will
find it).  Or go here https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded and
get pre-built tools.  There are many other folks maintaining cross
compiler toolchains that will also work.  My programs are not
specific to a -linux-gnueabi- or -none-eabi- gnu build, just needs
to be an arm gnu cross compiler.

I may also have the option to use the llvm clang compiler in the
Makefiles.  my build_gcc repository has a build_clang script that
will build llvm and clang from sources.
