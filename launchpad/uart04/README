datasheet for this microcontroller.  And information on how to load
programs into the microcontroller.

Derived from uart03.  This uses the timer0 32/64 bit timer in 32 bit
mode.  Using a preload of 0xFFFFFFFF the timer(s) can basically free
run.  I have set both the A and B timers (32 bits each) to count down
from 16 million.  Without a prescaler that would be one rollover per
second.  Timer A is not using a prescaler.  Timer B is set to divide
by 4 so for every 4 roll overs of timer A you get one roll over of
timer B.  Because this is polling the output may look a little strange
sometimes you get three A roll overs to one B and sometimes 4 A roll
overs to one B.  On average though it is a 4 to one.  change the prescaler
on B and the ratio changes accordingly.

This example is not about comparing timer a and timer b, but showing
that you can have two 32 bit timers within one timer module (timer0) and
that to use the "true prescaler" you need to be either in 16 bit mode
with the 16/32 bit timer or 32 bit mode with the 32/64 bit timer.
