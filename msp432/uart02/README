information.

If you are running with the as-shipped firmware then you can leave
uart_init uncommented.  It is already setup to work. Mine was shipped
using DCOCLK at 3MHz, so if you want to use the uart init change the
baud rate divisor register as noted in the code.

If you have run flash01 and wiped the main flash so that the bsl is
now running, then you need to uart init so uncomment the uart init,
which uses a divisor for 12mhz.

/dev/ttyACM0 is where I find the uart data

This example also uses uart2.  Whatever comes in uart0 rx goes out
uart2 tx, whatever comes in uart2 rx goes out uart0 tx.  So if you
connect uart2 tx and rx (p3.2 to p3.3), then what you type in
/dev/ttyACM0 goes out uart2, back in and echos out uart0.  if you
remove the jumper then it stops, put it back and it will work again.
