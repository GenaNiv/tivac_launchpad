Using a simple ir reciver module

http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10266

for this one

facing bump pins down 1 2 3
1 out
2 gnd
3 vcc

note that not all modules have the same pinout, get it wrong and you
let smelly smoke out.

This example takes the out signal from the receiver and basically
shows it on the led.  Your sensor may or may not invert, so with the
above, the led is off normally and blinks when there is the right kind
of ir (tv/etc remote controls).
