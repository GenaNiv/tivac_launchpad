Although these are technically perhaps not tiva branded products I just
got an MSP432 launchpad which is a cortex-m4 based, that is not
confgusing at all with msp430 being some completely different processor.

So they have switched the front end debugger portion to be compatible
with XDS100 and/or CMSIS-DAP (or both).  In theory I can dig up
my hercules boards (well the not bricked one) and perhaps have a chance
at talking to it (from linux without an ide).

I so far have not tried messing with flash, but I can load a program
into ram and run it using openocd and the msp432.cfg file in this
directory.

git clone git://repo.or.cz/openocd.git
cd openocd
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-legacy-ft2232_libftdi --enable-cmsis-dap
(not sure if the libftdi is even needed I use that for something else)
resolve dependencies (libftdi, etc) until configure works
make
sudo make install

blinker01 as of this writing doesnt actually blink it modifies a memory
location so I can see over jtag as I resume/halt it that it is changing
that memory location (that the program is really running)

my openocd script msp432.cfg is cobbled together from an stm32 one,
there might be a stock one from openocd that works in parallel with
cmsis-dap.cfg.  Mine is the only one you need

in one window

openocd -f msp432.cfg

in another window

telnet localhost 4440
> halt
> load_image /path/to/myprog.elf
> resume 0x01000000

Whatever directory you run the openocd server in is the base directory
so if you are in your programs development directory then you dont
need the path

cd blinker01
openocd -f ../msp432.cfg

then you can just do a load_image blinker01.gcc.thumb.sram.elf without
a path.


flash01 works to erase the program that comes with the device.  The
board will reset/power cycle into the bsl is what it appears.  Still
working out how to init the uart, but the blinkers work.

Interesting note I can sorta program the flash, enough to put a small
program but that pisses off the bsl or something, cant halt via jtag,
but I can follow the steps in flash01 to manually erase the first
sector in main again and reset and go back to the bsl.  but sometimes
cant actually run a program.
